# Zillow Neighborhood Maps of Seattle in GeoJSON and KML Formats

The good people at [Zillow](http://www.zillow.com/) have invested a lot of time defining the boundaries of around 7,000 neighborhoods in cities around the USA.

These are in the form of [ESRI ARC Shapefiles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile) that can be used as overlays on maps.

You can find these at [Zillow Neighborhood Boundaries](http://www.zillow.com/howto/api/neighborhood-boundaries.htm).

Zillow have kindly made these available to the rest of us under a [Creative Commons license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/). This allows you to share and modify the data but you need to attribute Zillow and must distribute any derivative forms of the data under the same or similar licenses. Attribution should take the form of including their logo with a link back to their site.

ESRI shapefiles can be read by many types of mapping software, but one big exception to this is [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com/). Overlays in Google Maps are loaded from [KML format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_Markup_Language) files. In addition [GeoJSON](http://www.geojson.org/) is a JSON-based format that is gaining in popularity.

I needed neighborhood boundaries for the City of Seattle in KML format so I can use them in Google Maps. I couldn't find a convenient way to convert from Shapefile directly to KML (although these do exist in some GIS packages) and the solution I came up with involved converting first from Shapefile to GeoJSON and them from GeoJSON to KML. I'll make that software available elsewhere.

This site contains the GeoJSON and KML files for the 78 Seattle neighborhoods defined in Zillow's dataset.

The same approach could be applied to derive GeoJSON and KML files for the entire Zillow US city dataset. I'll see if I can do that in the future... for now it just covers Seattle.


The KML format contains not only data but also styling information. This can be viewed as a benefit or disadvantage of the format. The KML files here all use the same styling information in the XML blocks at the top fo the file. Look for the strings 'ff000000' for the Line Style and '7FAAAAAA' for the fill style. It would be easy enough for you to modify these as needed. Check the KML documentation for guidance on KML styling.


# Example Map

See the file example.html for a basic example of a Google Map embedded in a page with a KML neighborhood overlay

# Using the Files

You can use either format of file in many GIS packages and mapping programs. Here are a few ideas for people who are new to this area of coding.

You can load KML files into your own maps using [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com/) directly. Look under 'My Places' -> 'Create Map' -> 'Import'. See Google Maps documentation for details.

You can load the KML files into Google Earth for a different experience. The command 'open <myfile>.kml' on a Mac with Google Earth installed should be enough.

To use these overlays in custom Google Maps you want to use the [Google Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/).

I'll add an example HTML page that shows how to do this in due course...

Two important things to note about testing KML overlays in Google Maps in your own HTML pages

1: Your KML files MUST be hosted on a remote server. They will be ignored if you give try and host them from a server on localhost !

2: KML files are CACHED in web pages, just like images. So if you are changing the files, such as changing the colors, these will not be visible unless you work around the caching issue. The easiest way to do this is to add a question mark followed by a random string at the end of the url for the KML file, and change this on every page reload.

For example: http://yourserver.net/yourfile.kml?1234567

You can generate a unique suffix in your JS like this:

```javascript
var url_suffix = (new Date).getTime().toString();
```


# Seattle Neighborhoods

It is difficult to define neighborhood boundaries. Those used by Zillow may not agree with your opinion. The City of Seattle hosts a set of pages on neighborhoods that form the [Seattle City Clerk's Office Geographic Indexing Atlas](http://clerk.seattle.gov/public/nmaps/neiglist.htm). Wikipedia also has more descriptive information on [Seattle Neighborhoods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighborhoods_in_Seattle).
